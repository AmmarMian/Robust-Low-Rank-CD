# Robust Low-Rank Change Detection for Heterogeneous SAR images

The work here correspond to a code for change detection for SAr images exploiting Low-rank structure and non-Gaussian assumptions.
It corresponds to a simulation done for a proposed IGARSS paper.

## Files' organisation

This folder is organised as follows:
- **change_detection_functions.py**: Contain the codes for every detector compared.
- **compute_distribution_eigenvalues_image_wevelet.py**: Code used for plotting the mean of eigenvalues over the image Time Series.
- **plot_roc_uavsar_dataset_wavelet.py**: ROC on real dataset by exploiting wavelet transform and statistics. Warning: Will download 28Go of data is not present.
- **plot_roc_uavsar_dataset_wavelet_sizofwindow.py**: Same as **plot_roc_uavsar_dataset_wavelet.py** but vary the size of window


## Requirements for Python
	The code provided was developped and tested using Python 3.7. The following packages must be installed 
	in order to run everything smoothly:
	- Scipy/numpy
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- wget (if you do not have the UAVSAR data yet)
	- tqdm

The code use parallel processing which can be disabled by putting the boolean enable_multi to False in each file.
The figures can be plotted using Latex formatting by putting the boolean latex_in_figures to True in each file (must have a latex distribution installed).
